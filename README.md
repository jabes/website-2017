# Website 2017

Personal website where I showcase some of my work.

## Requirements

The following programs must be install on your machine before you may install.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## How to install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jabes/website-2017.git
cd website-2017
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
